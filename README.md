Rust improvement tasks - things I'd like to see being implemented in/for Rust

This repository is created just for issues and serves as a collection of various ideas that I'd love to see implemented .
Hopefully some of these can be implemented by others.
I'm willing to provide consultation or deep code review for anyone willing to do them, just reply to an issue.
I will also probably implement some of them in my free time.
